# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a homepage for the Evolution About website that replicates the design and layout shown in the reference image. The homepage will be a static UI implementation focused on presenting scientific and educational content in a modern, dark-themed interface with component-based architecture. The page will display articles, videos, publications, and provide navigation and search functionality.

**Technology Update**: The implementation uses Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library instead of CSS Modules for styling, providing a utility-first approach with consistent, accessible components.
